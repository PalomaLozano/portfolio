            This project was created with Illustrator. It has a minimal style
            where the message prevails over technique. It was created for
            printing t-shirts and this are some of the best.

            This project was created with Illustrator. It has been created with
            yellow and a monochromatic pink, making a high contrast between the
            two colors. This mix of colors may provoke to the spectator a
            feeling of strengh and closeness at the same time.
