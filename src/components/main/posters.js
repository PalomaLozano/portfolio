            Here you can see a set of my best posters. They havenÂ´t got any
            correlation between them. They were used for expositions, solidarity
            groups, product sellers, yoga trainers... They were created with a
            mix of Photoshop, InDesing and Illustrator. Also, some photographies
            are mine.
